# Linear-polynomial-logistic-regression-practice-using-.CSV-data-set
I am new to Machine Learning . This is just a practice on the three types of regression using a Student Performance data set .
It was done using Jypter Notebook , and multiple libraries : sklearn to import the needed models and metrics such as mse , pandas to load the data set into a data frame and manipulate it and numpy for numeric operations .
The objective was to predict the score of the student based on the input lables . 
My goal of this project is to get more familiar with ML and its frameworks and learn more about it , apply what's learned and therefore gain more experience .
